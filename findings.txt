What determines a sudoku board's difficulty?

In my opinion, it is determined by the number of moves required to obtain a solution. 

The number of moves correlates positively with the number of possibilities a sudoku player has to explore before arriving at a solution. 

The more the number of moves, the more the possibilities, the harder it is to solve the puzzle. 

To track the number of moves, I placed a "moves" counter before we invoke function "make_move".

The "moves" variable is passed into the "solve_board" function as a reference variable. This is because:

1. I want the "solve_board" function to modify the variable, and
2. The "solve_board" function cannot output the "moves" variable --the function is required to output a boolean.

Let's now try to solve some puzzles, and track the number of moves made before arriving a solution, if any. 

The number of moves required to solve the board in "easy.dat" is 19,337.

The number of moves required to solve the boardin "medium.dat" is 140,743, approximately 7 times more than the easy board.

Let's assume the name of the data files indicates the difficulty of the sudoku boards. 

If this assumption is correct, then the number of moves is a reliable indicator of a board's difficulty. 

Now let's solve the mystery boards.

Solving puzzle in mystery1.dat is successful, and requires 3,793,687 moves. This is the board that is "extremely hard".

Solving puzzle in mystery2.dat failed after 103,797 moves. This is the board that is impossible to solve.

Solving puzzle in mystery3.dat is successful, and requires 126,954 moves. This is the board that is "hard".
