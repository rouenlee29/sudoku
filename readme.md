We represent a Sudoku board as a two dimensional array. Each position in the board is either empty, or contains a number from 1-9. 

Our goal is to fill in the empty spaces with numbers that abide by Sudoku rules (see sudoku.pdf).

We present a recursive solution for Sudoku in C++ (see sudoku.cpp). More specifically, we use backtracking to iteratively discover a solution to a Sudoku puzzle.
